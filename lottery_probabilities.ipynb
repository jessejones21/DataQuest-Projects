The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.\n",

    "Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending their savings or taking out loans, accumulating debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft. We are hoping that a more realistic view of how low the chances of winning the lottery actually are will discourage people from playing.\n",

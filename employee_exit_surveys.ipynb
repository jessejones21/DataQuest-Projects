    "In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. The stakeholders of these organizations have questions around employee resignation. We hope to utilize employee exit surveys to answer the following: \n",
    "* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",

    "In conclusion, employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time are less likely to resign due to some kind of dissatisfaction. Roughly half of the employees who had been with the institute for more than 7 years resigned due to some kind of dissatisfaction, almost 15% more than people who had been with the institute for less than 7 years. We saw a similar trend with age, there was a higher percentage of older employees resgining because they were dissatisfied compared to their younger counter parts. Employees 25 and under had the lowest number of dissatisfied employees (30%) and employees over 50 had the most (42%). While the age bracket 26-35 (39.8%) had 3% more employees resign due to dissatisfaction compared to 36-50 (36.8%)."
